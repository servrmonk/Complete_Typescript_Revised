we have some repeatation that u use same type more than one time ex in add u used union type two times u can optimize this with type alias
typescript have build in types operator which exist does not exist in js 
 
 with type u can create alias
 ex type NumOrString = number | string;
 so type alias can be very useful 

 now why u use alias or interface what is the difference : if u just defining the structure of the object u can use either of the 2 using interface is bit . interface can however use to force classes to implement certain method or functionality 

 if u would class or constructor just use class as a type or instantiate
